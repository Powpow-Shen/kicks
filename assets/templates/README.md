Handlebars templates go here
========

You can see there are two kind of files here.
The one with extension file name, 'handlebars', are handlebars templates, and anothers with extension file name, 'js', are precompiled handlebars templates.
We are not gonna use handlebars templates directly, but use precompiled handlebars templates.
The reason is that compiling handlebars templates is expensive, so please compile before launching the application.
